            <p>Dub's BBQ Sauce has been handcrafted in the Pacific Northwest for over 10 years.</p>
            <p>It started with a secret recipe. We made every batch of sauce by hand, canned it in our apartment in Kirkland, and gave it out to friends and family. Word got out, and every time we made it, we needed more jars.</p>
            <p>In 2022, we launched our first run of bottled sauce! We took Dub's BBQ to farmers' markets, craft fairs, and every party we got invited to!</p>
            <p>Dub's BBQ Sauce is named after our Australian Shepherd, Dub. <br>He's been the employee of the month since we started!</p>
