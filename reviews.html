            <p>"Legit the only BBQ I will use! It's the perfect texture with just the right amount of heat. I have yet to meet a meat that Dub's didn't elevate... chicken, pork, beef. Heck, it's even good on pizza! This stuff is seriously the BEST. And, with a pic of Dub himself on the bottle, what's not to love about this sauce?!"<span>&emsp;&ndash; Katie G.</p></span>
            <p>"Sh*t f*cking rocks!"<span>&emsp;&ndash; Tim S.</span></p>
            <p>"I've tasted lots of barbecue sauce in my day, and the Extra Heat flavor is right up there with the best of them nationally!"<span>&emsp;&ndash; Carolyn G.</span></p>
            <p>"Dub's BBQ is authentically one of those sauces that separates itself from all the rest! It has that homemade, quality, tried-and-true taste. We put it in everything! It's the bomb! Must try!"<span>&emsp;&ndash; Mary V.</span><br></p>
            <p>"I don't even like barbecue sauce, but I'll eat any meat with this sh*t on it!"<span>&emsp;&ndash; Cyn S.</span></p>
